Some code in R and C++(Rcpp) written for the paper " Understanding narwhal diving behaviour using Hidden Markov Models with dependent state distributions and long range dependence" [https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006425]

The main code is "main-code.R".

File "functions.cpp" provide C++ functions to support the analysis in the main R file.

Files "drawing.R" provides plotting functions for the main R file.

2 packages mt_1.0.tar.gz and plosM1_1.0.tar.gz are written in C++ (with Rcpp) to support fast computation in the analysis.
